This is basically  a project  that is able to determine prime numbers from an array of numbers that have been entered.This is made possible by the use of two functions.The first one is used to determine how prime numbers are going to be classified(numbers that are divisible by 1 and themselves).The second function is used to filter out the  prime numbers from an array of numbers that have been entered.the functions themselves make use of if...else statement and the traditional for loop.
